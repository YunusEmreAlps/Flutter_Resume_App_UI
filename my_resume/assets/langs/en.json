  "Hi, I'm Yunus Emre. I'm 21 years old from Konya. I'm a senior computer engineering student at Necmettin Erbakan University. I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionate about solving. This passion carried me through my education at Purdue. First, I learned C then C++. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination. \n\nI want to improve myself because I only ever want to be judged on the strength of my abilities and paid for it. And I want to be able to explain myself clearly, and have people receptive to my ideas. I'm here to learn what I wonder and to share what I know. \n\nSo, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There’s certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems, and yet more to build." : "Hi, I'm Yunus Emre. I'm 21 years old from Konya.

  "Apart from being a developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. I enjoy play guitar, learning new languages, meet new people.\n\nWhen forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the Programming world." : "Apart from being a developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors.
